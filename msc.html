                            <p id="just" >Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) is a new and rapidly emerging area of micro engineering. Through design and fabrication, MEMS technology combines different disciplines of engineering, physics, chemistry and biology to realise novel miniature devices such as sensors and actuators. 

                                    This course is designed to introduce students to microsystems technology and to provide the necessary knowledge and skills to design, model, fabricate and interface microsystem devices. The complementary unification of these areas gives the student an integrated systems approach necessary for sensible MEMS design. Throughout the course, an emphasis is placed on industrial and commercial applications of microsystem technology. Also, both electrical and optical MEMS devices within the micro device domain are explored. 
                                        The course topical outline provides a summary of course topics that can be used as a guide when progressing through the course. <br/><br/><br/>
